"""
Our maze explorer has some weird rules for finding the exit. It is up to you find out if it is possible with the following
rules,
whether they will escape.

Our explorer has the following rules:
They always walk 6 blocks straight and then turn 180Â° and start walking 6 blocks again.

If a wall is in their way they turn to the right,
if that not possible they turn to the left and if that is not possible,
they turn back from where they came.
